# Maui BOT
As you thank Maui for his hard work he welcomes you. Maui is a little mark-up bot created for the first ever Discord Hack Week. Entered into the 'Shitpost' category. As this can spam and annoy the server I felt that this was the correct category to enter, the other categories are; Productivity, Entertainment, Moderation & Social.

# Features
Whenever a user says thank you, Maui will spring into chat and surprise you with a 'You're welcome' GIF. You're welcome. 

> You're Welcome!
